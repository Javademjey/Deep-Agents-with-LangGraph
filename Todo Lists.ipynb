    "Imagine you're working on a really complex school project that has many steps. Without a plan, you might:\n",
    "- Forget what you were supposed to do next\n",
    "- Get distracted and wander off topic\n",
    "- Lose track of your progress\n",

    "\n",

    "#### The Solution: TODO Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you might write down a checklist for your project, we're teaching our AI agent to:\n",
    "1. **Create a TODO list** at the start of a task\n",
    "2. **Update the list** as it completes each step  \n",
    "3. **Review the list regularly** to stay focused\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Why ToDo Lists? Planning for Long Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents can lose focus during long tasks (many steps, lots of tool calls). A ToDo list acts like a compass:\n",
    "- The model writes a small, structured list of tasks (each has `content` and `status`: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`).\n",
    "- The list is rewritten as progress is made. This “recitation” keeps the goals fresh in the agent’s context to avoid drift.\n",

    "2. It follows the simple research instruction:\n",
    "   - Calls `web_search` once to get the MCP info.\n",
    "3. It may call `read_todos` to refresh the list in context, or call `write_todos` again to mark items as completed.\n",
