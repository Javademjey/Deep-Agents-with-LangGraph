    "   - Has its own prompt (SIMPLE_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS)\n",
    "   - Has only `web_search` as a tool\n",
    "   - Makes a single `web_search` call (per instructions)\n",
    "   - Produces a final answer\n",

    "**5. The `task` tool:**\n",
    "   - Returns a `Command` that:\n",
    "     - Merges any file changes\n",
    "     - Converts the sub-agent’s final message to a `ToolMessage` for the supervisor\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why This Pattern Is Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "- Isolation by design\n",
    "  - Each sub-agent gets only what it needs: a task description + limited tools\n",
    "- Safer, clearer reasoning\n",
    "  - No accidental interference from unrelated prior messages\n",
    "- Scales with complexity\n",
    "  - Multiple sub-agents can run in parallel for orthogonal subtasks\n",

    "  - Add more sub-agents (e.g., “summarizer-agent”, “code-agent”, “planner-agent”) by adding entries to the config list and giving them tool subsets and prompts\n"
