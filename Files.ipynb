    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code shows how AI agents can become much smarter by learning to save and retrieve information, just like how you might take notes during a long study session!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Problem: Information Overload\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working on a really long research project. After hours of gathering information, you might:\n",
    "- Forget important details from earlier\n",
    "- Lose track of your original question  \n",
    "- Get overwhelmed by too much information at once\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents face the same challenge! When they work on complex tasks (like researching a topic), their \"memory\" (context window) gets filled up with:\n",
    "- All the previous conversation\n",
    "- Tool call results\n",
    "- Intermediate findings\n",
    "- Background information\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **\"context accumulation\"** like your desk getting messier as you work on a big project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: A Virtual Filing Cabinet\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to teach our AI agent to use a \"filing cabinet\" - a virtual file system where it can:\n",
    "1. **Save important information** to files instead of keeping everything in memory\n",
    "2. **Read back specific information** when needed\n",
    "3. **Stay organized** by listing what files it has\n",
    "4. Keeps the LLM **context clean and focused**.\n",
    "5. **Preserves important intermediate results** (plans, notes, data) outside the prompt window.\n",
    "6. Enables sub-agents or later steps to **retrieve exact details without repeating everything**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like taking organized notes during research - you write things down so you don't forget them, and you can look them up later!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I said this to introduce the concept of context offloading, what it is and what it does for us.\n",
    "The issues we face and solve next:\n",
    "- Why context offloading matters for agents\n",
    "- How a virtual filesystem works inside LangGraph state\n",
    "- How to build and use file tools: `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`\n",
    "- How the agent uses these tools in a simple research task\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll go in the same order as your script: concept → state → tools → prompt/agent → run and inspect.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's trace through what happens when a user asks: *\"Give me an overview of Model Context Protocol (MCP).\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Check What Files Exist\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent calls: ls()\n",
    "Result: [] (empty list - no files yet)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Save the User's Request\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent calls: write_file(\"user_request.txt\", \"User Request: Give me an overview of Model Context Protocol...\")\n",
    "Result: \"Updated file user_request.txt\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is smart**: The agent saves the original question so it won't forget what the user actually asked for, even after doing lots of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Do Research\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent calls: web_search(\"Model Context Protocol MCP overview...\")\n",
    "Result: [Information about MCP]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Re-read Original Request\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agent calls: read_file(\"user_request.txt\")\n",
    "Result: Shows the original user request with line numbers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is brilliant**: Before answering, the agent checks its notes to make sure it answers exactly what the user asked for!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Provide Comprehensive Answer\n",
    "The agent now has:\n",
    "- The original question (from its file)\n",
    "- Research results (from web search)\n",
    "- Clear focus on what to answer\n",
