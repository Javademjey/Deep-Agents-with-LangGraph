# Deep-Agents-with-LangGraph
This repository contains 5 documents, each of which I took notes for a section of the `LangChain Academy Deep Agents with LangGraph` course.

The course itself has repositories that it provides you with. If my documents are not useful to you, I suggest you check them out.

There are now several successful examples of very **capable** and **long-running** agents. They have given these agents the 
name `“Deep Agents”` because they believe that they are completely different from previous generations of agents. In 
this course, you will learn what makes them different and build your own Deep Agent.

In LangChain, a Deep Agent is built that is simple and configurable, allowing users to build long-running agents quickly and easily.

In this course, you will build a **Deep Research Agent** using Deep Agent. The course is divided into seven modules.

Each module includes a video lesson that introduces you to the key concepts, along with related workbooks.
